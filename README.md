### Challenges
1. Making the play button do exactly what I wanted: I had not made a separate HTML page for the game page itself so going from the homepage to the game display was quite difficult. I had to remove the homepage elements and then create and display the game page elements to replace the homepage ones.
2. In-game, generating another word with another colour with every click. Initially when I tried this, the display created an element with the same word with the same colour every time, while still keeping the old element. To overcome this, I decided to change the contents of the current elements as opposed to trying to remove and replace them.

### Learning points
I learned how to implement a gradient background, which I had not done or seen before. The concept wasn't difficult to understand but the code itself was a little tricky. I also now know how to make better use of functions and calling them later in multiple places later on as opposed to just creating the function exactly where I want them to take place.
